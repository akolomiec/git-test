# WP PRO Countdown Timer
 Plugin that allows you to simply and easily integrate a timer into your WordPress site.

## Features

- Activating/Deactivating timer sections
- Sections Setting and Textfields settings
- Custom timer end date
- Shortcode Generation
- Support for multiple timers on one page
- Time zone support from WordPress settings
- Input data validation (kernel crash protection)

## Installation

Just install the plugin using the archive inside the admin panel or drag the plugin folder to the `wp-content/plugins` directory

## How to use? (5 simple steps)

1. In the WordPress settings, find the "Timers" tab and create your own timer. 
2. Customize it to your needs. 
3. Copy the shortcode from the list of your timers. 
4. Add a shortcode to any WordPress page. 
5. Enjoy how it works!

## Shortcodes

All shortcodes have the format as: `[wppct-timer id=""]`. Shortcodes without an id parameter (or with an incorrect id parameter) will not work

## Support

If you have any problems (bugs, flaws, etc.), then create an issue in this repository. I will try to process them as soon as possible.
